        <p class="large-paragraph">
          “Education educates a man, but good education creates a man” is the
          belief of NJR Foundation which established Techno India NJR Institute
          of Technology in the year 2008. NJR Foundation, a registered trust,
          was established in the year 2003 in memory of Shri Navdeep Ranawat and
          Shri Jitendra Ranawat by Mrs. Meera Ranawat and Mr. Raj Shekhar Vyas,
          an alumnus of BITS, Pilani having more than 25 years of experience
          with Tata group and as Techno entrepreneur. Nine more highly qualified
          trustees with vast experience in the field of law, administration,
          finance research papers writing and business were inducted
          subsequently. Techno NJR was set up with a vision of providing
          international level engineering education to students of Udaipur so
          that they do not have to travel to Banglore, Pune, Jaipur for good
          engineering education.
